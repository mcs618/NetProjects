@Mark Schwartz General pattern is to catch the output and then add a conditional.

In Netmiko it would look like this:

output = net_connect.send_command_timing("clear counters")
if 'confirm' in output:
    output += net_connect.send_command_timing("\n")
print(output)

Note, the use of send_command_timing which is delay based 
(i.e. waits a certain amount of time).
